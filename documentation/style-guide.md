**Agile California Prototype Style Guide**

We used a Bootstrap theme for the prototype site (please see http://www.monolinea.com/projects/styleguide/ for reference). The reason we chose Bootstrap for this project is that it is not only a complete framework that provides a responsive site and a polished look and feel with minimal changes needed, which is ideal for a prototype, but also serves as the foundation for the U.S. Digital Standards theme that we would recommend implementing.

The only deviation from Bootstrap is in the header and favicon. We chose to include the CHHS logo and favicon so that the prototype would include branding as established by the California Health and Human Services organization.
