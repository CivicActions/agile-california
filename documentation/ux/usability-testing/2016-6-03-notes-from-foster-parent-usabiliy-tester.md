Hello,

I went and played around in the different sections you provided me access to. I have some suggestions outlined below. Let me know if you have any questions.

**Foster-Parent**
Foster Parent Profile - Fostering Tab

 1. When did you become... 
	 A. Change to: # of years as an active foster parent.
		 a. Reason: Foster parents can go on long breaks not taking in any children. 
		 
 2. Add "Home Licensed for:" and below give a drop down for types of licensing; Medically Fragile, Emergency, FFA, etc. A. Reason: Very helpful for the case workers to know this immediately.
 3. Number of Biological Children in home
    A. Add: age(s)
    B. Add: option "# of Adopted Children in home" along with age(s)
    C. Add: option "# of Foster Children in home" along with the child name, age and worker name(s)
	    a. Not sure of this addition --> with each foster child in home, also add "Last Hearing Held" with drop down of types of hearings; *J&D, 6 month, 12 month, .26, etc*. <-- 
	    I. Reason: Might help the worker to know how much longer a child will be in the care of this family or when the family is available to add another child to their home.
	    
 4. Add "Respite Availability?" with an answer box maybe??

**Case-Worker**
*Social Worker Profile*

 1. When you became a worker?
	A. Change to: "# of years with Child Welfare Services?"
	
 2. Add: "Supervisor Name"
 3. Add: "Type of Worker:" along with a drop down of options; Removal, Placement, Continuing Services, Adoption, PPU, etc.
    A. Reason: Can easily identify as what stage the case is in.

*Contact Info*

1. Add: Email address

**Case-Manager**
This seems to be a duplicate of the 'Case-Worker' file. Unsure why there are two.

Hope this is helpful and that it makes sense. :)
