First of all, see Amy’s notes in email from Friday afternoon. Great observations here. Next, my own:

 1. A few places in where asterisks appear next to input fields for apparently no reason (next to "urgent" in message creation view, "I work with a foster agency", preferred child age) [this has now been fixed].
 2. In profile edit view, there's no help text to indicate that asterisk is a required field (until after one tries to save values with any of those blank and error message appears). 
 3. "From" field is blank, logged in as case-worker, viewing on Safari and in Chrome. See screenshot. It appears when logged in as foster-parent. 
 4. Inbox needs helptext to indicate that the number in parentheses after message title is # of replies. 
 5. The "Unread" tag in the inbox only appears if the last message in a thread is ​*not*​ from the present user. This is helpful in that it informs the user when there is something for them to read, but it seems it would be helpful to have it appear for the SENDER of the message as well, so that they could log in and see when the other party has read or seen their message.
 6. Map: I entered a dummy value in the zip field at first, and then when I realized this would control what I see on the map page, I went back and included a real live CA zip. The Map page retained my old dummy value, and did not update to the new value. Even logging out and back in didn't refresh the zip value for the map. [This has been fixed.]
 7. Might all users (but especially case workers) be interested in viewing the map for areas other than their own home zip? Not sure it should default snap to home zip.
 8. Map not loading - Case worker has legit CA zip (94207) and nothing loads on the page ("no facilities found near 94207") (edited) [this has been fixed.]
