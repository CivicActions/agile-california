- What could they gain from a new system?

##User Interview Questions##
###General Notes:###

Try to ask open-ended questions first, before asking “leading” questions which presuppose a technical solution or even pre-suppose a need.

Try to find needs the state may not have recognized, but don’t invest too much time in this.  We need to focus on what can be implemented which mostly overlaps what the state is asking for.  We must think carefully before investing in a pressing need which the state has not requested.

###General Introduction:###

- “Thanks for sharing your time and experience with us.”
- “If we’re lucky, what you share with us will help us help the state of - California eventually make it easier to be a foster parent.”
- “We are in learning-and-listening mode.  The state has written some things that are not entirely clear to us. You may or may not be able to help us understand what they want and what makes sense.”
- “However, we know being a foster parent is a tough and valuable job, but today we are restricting our discussion to things the state seems to want to address.”
- "We would like to record this conversation for future reference, with your permission. May we have your consent to continue?"
