*We’ve worked with Foster Club for a few years - have you worked with them for long?*
Been doing Foster care for 15 months, but just introduced to Foster Club

*Are you pretty comfortable with technology?*
Have smartphone, ipad, desktop - work with it every day - not a pro, but do use social media
Primarily use phone or tablet 

*Do you generally foster a youth for a long time? How long? How many youths have you fostered?* 
8 kids; 4 providing assistance for another foster family - busy year
Is it easy for the state to match a youth to you? - asked us what age we preferred; chose 5-18+ (school age) - then opened it up from 0+; mom is helping us out during work day
Signed up through county - would love to work with agency but would require a meeting every week and I don’t have time for that with full-time job

**CASEWORKER COMMUNICATION**

*Do you have a “case worker”? Or do the youths have a “case worker”?* 
Yes, I have a county caseworker; each child has their own social worker; emergency worker for first 40 days; later a permanent social worker until they go to youth services; we have a recruitment / development support worker also - will be there for us for assistance / support
Primary point of contact is the child’s social worker - they are supposed to respond within 24 hours, but we have had no response for 3 weeks - not communicating with us; leave messages with supervisors, etc. They have a lot of cases, so recruitment development team can help in those cases when we have trouble getting in touch with social worker = usually have a response from them within 2 hours

*What are challenges for social workers?* 
After 72 hours, I say “I know you’re extremely busy… “ - they may have been in court for 3 days straight and not accessed a computer - supervisors say this isn’t acceptable; I offer grace because I’ve seen their caseloads; they are overloaded

*What have you been trying to reach social worker about recently?* 
Usually I contact her if I’m monitoring a visit and need to tell her how things went - have to report the doctor’s report - my job is to keep social worker aware of how child is doing

We email and text, works best; sometimes we schedule a time for a phone call - such good communication is unusual (Tiffany - she is a model social worker - follow up with her if possible)

*What is the nature of comms with social worker?* Good one will be detailed - could be quick yes or no, with explanation - 20% of questions could be answered with yes/know - other comms are more detailed
I try to communicate with social worker on lunch break / before work/ or end of day

**RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES**
*The state mentions “finding children’s residential facilities in your zip code.” How do you use residential facilities? Is knowing about them important to you?*
I think I did that one time within the last 6 months; found limited, outdated info - we were fostering a child with mental health issues; we looked to find additional services for this child; it would have been ideal not to have to call the head of youth services - they have all the tools and should be directing us to them - social worker not doing job

**ONLINE PROFILE**
*If you had a profile online, who would that be valuable to?*
If social worker were responsive, it could be of value to them to learn a little bit about families - might help with placement
We have good placement workers in Ventura County - check with placement workers about what info they need in a profile
My work schedule changes - keeping this updated would be helpful - updated contact info
I've learned to communicate through email so I have a paper trail for social worker - private messaging?

*What could the state most improve about how it gives you information?*
A portal would be awesome - want each social worker to take the time and be invested
Reframing of the whole system - so people come in and open their hearts - steps toward this.

YES willing to look at prototype
