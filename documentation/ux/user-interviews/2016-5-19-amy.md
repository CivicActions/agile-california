**Background questions for use to understand their general situation:**
*Are you pretty comfortable with technology?*
Quick learner; did some online work/home self-employed - Etsy, Ebay, etc. 
Comfortable with the basics; as long as I have someone to help
*Do you have a smartphone?* Yes, laptop and PC
*Do you enjoy using your smartphone?* Use as many apps as I can - kids in teens

**General questions:**
*Do you generally foster a youth for a long time? How long?* 4 years; infants only - have 2 older bio kids 
*How many youths have you fostered?* - fostered 6 babies / newborns - 2 were a couple months old, but too old for us - we prefer newborns!
Is it easy for the state to match a youth to you? We are certified through foster agency; subcontractor for county - Angels Foster Family agency - kids 0-5; severe neglect, drug abuse; we deal with younger kids to make a difference as early as possible; allowed to have 1 child at a time - more attention and love for each child; agency has its own strict rules - stricter than county - have our own worker at agency; county calls them, and we get a call from agency worker and pick up baby
Our job is to care and love these children
sometimes county workers contact us directly
We handoff details to our worker - stuff like disagreements with bio family / details about reunification plan - hard for us to explain this info; our only job is to care for child

**CASEWORKER COMMUNICATION**
*Do you have a “case worker”? Or do the youths have a “case worker”?*
They are a social worker - at agency; 12 people on caseload - available to us 24/7; county workers have a lot more children in case load
*How do you currently communicate with your case worker?*
Hit or miss - depends on worker; sometimes phone, sometimes text or email
Had one who was email - others don’t like to give out email or phone
Very hard to get in touch with workers / to get information at the right time
Looking for easier communication with COUNTY - Agency worker is there for us 24/7, all communication channels available; when agency office is closed, we need to be able to communicate with county - how to know if they got the message, when they will respond?

*When do you need to reach county worker?* Last baby - had her for 6-7 weeks, then she moved to foster-to adopt transition; I didn’t have my cell phone on me, then got a text from new parent, county hadn’t contacted me right away; now I have a new parent asking me questions about the baby; parent is excited - I can’t tell her anything - it’s 5pm, county office is closing so I can’t contact them, can only leave message; didn’t get call back for 24 hours; next day county workers were in training all morning while I i was trying to meet with parent - office worker had to run around to tell me the policy - crazy

NEED TO KNOW IF/WHEN SOMEONE IS WORKING on it

I know there must be someone in office who can look up the case and approve communication - I have to push the person who answers the phone to find a supervisor so I can act / communicate with parent / drags on / it’s very hard - to have NO CONTROL over a situation / affects the child
Basic communications are difficult  / not one simple way to contact each other / 

**RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES**
*The state mentions “finding children’s residential facilities in your zip code.” How do you use residential facilities? Is knowing about them important to you?*
I don’t use those - if I’m hearing right, foster homes, group homes? I would be considered a regular, general foster home - don’t need to look those up as a foster parent; that would be something the county worker would have to do for the child

**ONLINE PROFILE**
*If you had a profile online, who would that be valuable to?*
My info would be valuable to another foster parent - someone coming into the system may want to talk to me about my knowledge of system - already talked about in FB groups - we specialize in fostering babies - helpful info to someone
And, county or group that would want to do research into something
County workers sometimes contact foster parents directly; assume they have a DB they already use - types of families / foster parents organized by categories / types of homes
Workers only contact the families they are in contact with already - sit on case if those families are full - a profile listing could help with that

YES interested in participating - we will follow up, probably tomorrow; delivery on Wednesdays and Fridays and will be in touch to take a look
