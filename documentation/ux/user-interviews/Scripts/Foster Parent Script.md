**Foster Parent interview script**

*General Introduction:*

 - Hi NAME, Thank you for sharing your time and experience with us. We’re a digital agency working with government agencies to help improve the systems they are providing. We’re hoping to get some feedback from you about the frustrations, challenges and successes you face - this will help us do our work. If we’re lucky, what you share with us will help us to help the state of California to eventually make it easier to be a foster parent. We are in learning-and-listening mode. The state has written some things that are not entirely clear to us. You may or may not be able to help us understand what they want and what makes sense. We know being a foster parent is a tough and valuable job, today we are restricting our discussion to things the state seems to want to address. 
 - We would like to record this conversation for future reference, with your permission. May we have your consent to continue? 
 - We expect this interview to take about 25 minutes - do you have any questions about the process?

 - What types of devices do you use? 
 - Do you use the internet a lot? 
 - Do you have a preferred device for accessing information and services online?

**General Questions:**

 - Could you tell us a little bit about your overall experience as a foster parent?
 - How many youths have you fostered?
 - Do you generally foster a youth for a long time? How long?
 - Is it easy for the state to match a youth to you?

**CASEWORKER COMMUNICATION**

 - Do you have a “caseworker”? 
 - Or do the youths have a “caseworker” or social worker? 
 - How do you currently communicate with your caseworker?

**RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES**

 - How do you use residential facilities? 
 - Is knowing about them important to you? 
 - If you could better search for facilities, how would you like to find one? Who would want to find those residential facilities?

**ONLINE PROFILE**

 - If you had a profile online, who would that be valuable to?
 - Help us understand what the state means by “entering and managing your profile.” Does the state use a profile to match you with youths? 
 - If so, how do you enter and manage that profile today? 
 - Or is the profile used for something else? 
 - If you have to manage a profile, how would you prefer to do that?

**OTHER**

**SUMMARY**

 - What most frustrates with you about information delivery from the state? 
 - What could the state most improve about how it gives you information?

That’s it for my questions. Is there anything else you’d like to tell me about what we discussed?

Next steps...

We’ll take the problems that people have, identify which of those problems to focus on fixing, and we’ll come up with a prototype of solution - we will be looking for input from you.
