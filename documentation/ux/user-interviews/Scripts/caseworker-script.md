**Caseworker interview script**

 - Hi Name, Thank you for sharing your time and experience with us. We’re a digital agency working with government agencies to help improve the systems they are providing. We’re hoping to get some feedback from you about the frustrations, challenges and successes you face - this will help us do our work. 
 - If we’re lucky, what you share with us will help us to help the state of California to eventually make it easier to be a caseworker and a foster parent. 
 - We would like to record this conversation for future reference, with your permission. May we have your consent to continue?

   the process?
