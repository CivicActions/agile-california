**Typical Workday**

 - Mobile workers 
	 - Don’t have to report to office 
	 - Usually at home
	 - On call
 - Communication 
	 - Office calls to tell her she has case, emails case, then she uses her car to go to the site, gets in contact with family
	 - Gives people her cell phone
	 - Doesn’t communicate with clients via email 
	 - Let's client take the lead
		 - Sometimes text, sometimes calls 
 - Case Load 
	 - 1-2 cases per night 
	 - Shouldn’t have case more than 7 days because she’s in ER 
		 - Turnaround is very quick 
	 - 2-3 most at one time 
 - In contact more with biological parents than foster families 
 - Issues 
	 - Placement
		 - When they can visit 
		 - Where are they being placed
		 - Parents can’t visit when children are in shelter care, only foster 
 - Good at calling people back immediately

**Residential facilities**

 - Residential facilities = group homes 
 - Where child gets placed depends on issues 
 - Residential facilities for certain behavioral  problems where placement with families would be harmful 
 - Advanced  Placement Team would find it useful to find residential facilities
	 - Mostly just call and ask for room 
	 - Information is there, but maybe  not updated
 - Regular foster homes are already in the system with  number of beds available 
 - Foster parents have no need to look at  facilities

**Profile**

 - Would slow down placement of kids if biological parents could see foster parents
 - Placement team would benefit
	 - I.e. This person is good for these types of children (infants, fosters, etc)

**Rachel's Long term cases**

 - Up to 25 cases to manage at time when working with families
 - More contact with foster parent than biological
	 - Did have both
 - Calls
 - List of people who’ve called you and you need to return not necessarily helpful, usually boss takes those calls
	 - Voicemail serves as that list
 - Most helpful for foster parent would be if they could get automatic update on child status
 - If foster parent could get updates on who parents are, what are their visitations, how long visits can be, what are rules, if child needs to see doctor, what else child needs to do.
 - ***Nobody reaches out to foster parents to tell them that parents are now allowed to visit and the foster parent has to call the case worker***
	 - Should be updated with court orders
	 - Case workers don’t get that immediately

**Suggestions**

 - a way to automatically assign requests to someone else in the system if you're unavabile
 - they can indicate request as urgent, since requests like tattoos aren't the same as a kid is deathly ill
