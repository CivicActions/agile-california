**Henry’s additions:**

 - Some issues are urgent, some are not. Case workers have it hard and
   are pulled in many directions. Case worker interviews will be
   critical for this project.

**Owen & the Hello World items**

 - Demo of the dev server
 - Demo of a change/deployment with some Jenkins action. This could be deployed as often as we want. Look at the nebula repo readme for more documentation on how this fulfills USDS playbook items.
 - Sidenote: Facebook’s “report a post” feature, and the empathy built into that. (Wisdom 2.0 talk from 3 years ago?)
