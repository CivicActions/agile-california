**What do we need to do differently?**

 1. might be nice to get to recording hypotheses, even roughing out prototypes at this point. I think we have some good ideas already
 2. Each sprint should have something that gets to "done". ASAP we should do collaborative interface sketching.
 3. Github training - Adam can facilitate.
 4. Rotate team members in on interviews when possible.
 5. Forward looking:  Get people involved in UX (next week).
 6. Commit messages & stackedit:  Consider a pull request for all commits in this way so that commit messages are useful.
 7. Standardize on a single date format
 8. Have a better definition/documentation of our process.
 9. use LoWErCase OnLY for file names, pick a single date format.
 10. Try and keep commit messages useful (since they are part of our deliverable)
