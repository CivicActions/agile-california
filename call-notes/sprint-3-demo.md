**Demo**
May 27

- Foster Parent Amy joined
- We showed wireframes for inbox, message, user profiles

**Outcomes**
- Update wireframes and story map to capture the ideal project. Build out the MVP with a subset of these stories.
- Profiles are mostly valuable for social worker

**Questions for our users:**

 - Is there any value in having a map of residential facilities?
 - When would a foster parent ever use residential facilities?
 - What should go in a parent’s profile?
 - Do you want to see a child’s profile?
 - What should go into a child’s profile?
 - Do you want to see a caseworker’s profile?
 - Is visitation status important enough for you to get notifications of changes?
 - Is visitation status something you would need to check often?
 - Is there some other status that changes pretty often that you need to know about?
 - Do you need help planning visitations (like at restaurants or something?)
 - What sort of archive of records of communication do you want?

**Demo call notes**
Amy's responses/feedback

*Inbox*
 
 - Looks like what I would expect
 - Q: is this an app?
 - Having a “Johnny” icon on phone would be crazy for social worker - because they would have 30 icons

*Create a message*

 - Looks good

*Message itself*

 - Carbon copy (cc) area - need to copy agency manager / case worker / attorney - eliminates the forwarding of messages
 - Simplicity is good

*Profile*

 - What is the purpose?
 - Workers looking to connect parents to parents? Similar experiences
 - Workers using it on their end to figure out placement?
 - For me: might be helpful to not have a lot of information - would be like an address book
 - Might be more helpful for worker to put a name to a face - to differentiate between 40+ parents
 - Consider adding: children / cases that foster parent has in her care / cases for worker - helpful for worker, keep them informed
 - Kid’s profile: as simple as possible - confidentiality, etc.
 - Who can see what info?
 - Needs to be a confidentiality rule - maybe age, first name, where that child’s case is in the process
 - Would be helpful for the social worker knows who’s in my home at what time
 - Profiles mostly valuable for social workers
 - For me: address book would be useful - name, type of worker, phone number, contact hours
 - Selecting a child happens on the phone - probably has to be done verbally for legal reasons (not on app)

**Follow-up questions**
*Residential facilities - the case we know of is finding “respite.” Would a map of facilities would be useful to you?*

 - As agency parent, no because they take care of that for me
 - As regular county parent, maybe, because they have to do more on their own
 - Use case: foster family emergency; plain old “we need a break” from the child

*Do you need to know about different facilities?*

 - Yes, if it were my responsibility to find respite, I would love to see a DB to see that is available - to see a profile for a res facility so I knew what kind of place it is / if it’s appropriate
 - Now, they have to call to find out who is available
 - Or they ask on the local FB group
 - Respite could be with another family (as opposed to institution)
 - Soon, CA will be changing how facilities/group homes are used

*Emergency caseworker we spoke to raised the issue of visitation status; court-mandated change in visitation status requires communication between bio parents / foster parents / workers How would you like to learn of visitation status?*	

 - I would LOVE to know about it when it’s changed - ASAP
 - Would like to see it in app/profile - AWESOME
 - Would be great to get a message in my inbox / email so I would know right away, would be amazing for parents

*Would visitation status on child’s profile be useful?*	

 - For me, it wouldn’t matter too much
 - If I had access to that profile, would mean I had that child
 - Both being notified of status and going into profile to check/see status would be useful
 - Right now it’s me making a phone call and waiting / hoping someone calls me

*Would you have a need for an electronic way to coordinate a visitation location?*

 - YES, every time we get a placement, we are constantly asking other parents for location
 - ideas - needs to be a safe place
 - Drop down, way to look for a place in the middle (geographically)
 - Within residential piece there may be a need to a drop-off so they don’t have to drive all the way to a respite facility
 - I have never heard that the state provides safe drop-off places

*Audit / paper trail - what might archive look like?*

 - Would be useful
 - In beginning we just contact social worker without cc-ing supervisor - we need sometime that shows the record of communication attempts
 - Screen print-off?
 - Go to child’s profile and it would have all the times I sent messages regarding that child
 - Simplest thing would be to have child-specific separation of the messages
 - Amy is very excited that anyone is thinking about addressing these issues!

*Message categories*
Add these to the wireframe:

 - Foster family agency (FFA)
 - Medical Incident - Doctor’s office, immunizations, injury - we have to take them to urgent care if they get hurt
 - Services: Therapy - there are regular therapeutic services 
 - Visitation

**After meeting thougts:**
Elizabeth: Child’s profile only editable by caseworker
Messaging system is different from email because there aren’t other emails to sort through
In future, we may implement notification (any urgent message triggers text for example)
Henry: simplicity, what if you trigger your phone for a phone call?
We can present to Amy for validation
If call is initiated here, user would have a record of it
