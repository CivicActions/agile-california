Present: Owen Barton, April Rose, Henry Poole, Robert Read, Heather Rodriguez

* Discussed CiviCRM & CiviCase - think it is overall a good fit for prototype needs, but concerned it boxes us in architecturally and also adds significant complexity and could obscure our demonstration of agile software development.
* Discussed alternate support ticket systems - these seem to be a decent fit for the messaging aspect, but less so for profiles and API integration, and also would make a CRM integration conceptually harder.
* Plan is to focus on highest priority stories identified by users and focus on a lightweight implementation that meets those primary needs whilst prioritizing flexibility for further development and refinement as our understanding of user needs expands.

Action items

* April and Owen - proceed with Drupal 8 as base architecture, leaves flexibility as we learn more about user needs, options for CRM integration etc.
* UX team - better articulate and prioritize stories, wireframe as needed (e.g. inbox) to communicate specific user needs.
