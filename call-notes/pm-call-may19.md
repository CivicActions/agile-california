Decisions Made:
---------------

 - Elizabeth to be journaler of project and Agile Coach
 - Jason to be delivery manager
 - Steve to be delivery manager (if Jason has to jump off project)
 - We'll try to use Waffle for task tracking
 - We'll use 15 min of Friday's demo for a sprint retrospective
 - Use GDoc for notes, with Stackedit used as a format preservation tool.  (Revised: This won't work as expected)
 - Email list will not be used for note distribution any longer


Action Items:
-------------

 - Jason: Get buy-in from team on using Waffle during scrum tomorrow
 - Steve: work with Henry on getting role descriptions into Harvest


Unresolved:
-----------

 - Budget finalization
