**Goals for demo of sprint 5**
 - Review navigation and mobile responsiveness. See map, messaging, and usr profile. Gather feedback from case worker on what a bio parent would want in this application.

**Demo'd**
- Feedback from foster mom Amy:
	- create homepage (make user story)
	- Profile
		- remove time zone
		- change "edit" to say "account settings"
		- # of bio kids: Amy says the word bio doesn't include adopted, so change it to bio/adopted kids.
		- Preferred contact method: wants to choose more than 1. Not a high priority for her.

- Inbox
  - Can unread be bolded or a diff color?

- Demo to Case Worker. We learned yesterday that "parents" in the RFI was referring to bio parents and we had been thinking of foster parents. Today we are changing our plan in this demo to ask the Case Worker about what the bio parents would want in this application.
	- bio parents are not allowed to see foster parent profile at this time.
	- sometimes a child is placed far from where the bio parent lives and that is an issue, so location is important
	- Residential facilities map: she is not sure if locations are available for bio parents
	- arranging visitation at safe locations is important
	- Communication happens by phone via text or call. 
	- Before the child is placed in a foster home, the bio parent sends a lot of info about people they want the child to be placed with. Placement Prospects.
	- What is the biggest problem that you the case worker have with communicating to bio parents? Bio parents call her asking the same questions over and over. Example is about visitation, but they can't do visitation until placement happens. Perhaps revealing status and having notifications pushed when status changes would give the parent more info.
	- If child is in hospital then goes to foster care, it would be good to get an update to start placement or pick up child.
	- Everything is by phone to find out info, they want things in place to notify 
	- It would be helpful for the bio parent and the child to communicate to reduce anxiety, provided that there aren't restrictions on contact.
