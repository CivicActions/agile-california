Sprint 2 Planning Meeting

Rob was absent, so the team elected Jen as the interim PO

Sprint Goals:
Research of a private message/ticketing/support systems
Select a support system to implement based on evaluation criteria 
Create a paper prototype of the integrated support system once selected
Make remaining technical decisions and initialize installation of system once the support system is selected
Progress to the point of getting something that users can review by sprint 3
Get github training for those who need it

Assumptions:
We assume that caseworkers will be overwhelmed by realtime communications (like txting) and choose to focus our evaluation on delayed “inbox” style messaging. We will confirm this assumption with caseworker interviews.

Further plans:
See Waffle for specific tickets. Waffle is open to other ticket additions. Please do so!
We will run all of these decisions/goals and any work in progress by Rob on Monday to confirm we’re on the right track.

Associated user stories (in order of importance):
As a foster parent I would like to private message my case worker, and indicate the priority / urgency of the message.
As a foster parent I would like to be able to archive messages so that I have a paper trail in case I need to go to court.
As a foster parent I want my profile and facility lookup experience to be seamlessly integrated with my messaging experience.
