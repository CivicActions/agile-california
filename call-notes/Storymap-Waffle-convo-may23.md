Call Notes - Waffle / Storymapping Conversation from May 23
-----------------------------------------------

 - The Story Map that exists at storiesonboard will function as an authoritative "big picture" view of the project
 - Individual user stories will be duplicated to the Waffle board and given the user story label (gold)
 - There may be multiple tasks within the Waffle card in order to fulfill the user story
 - Use the Ready column to indicate current sprint tasks that have not yet been started
 - Use the In Progress column to indicate current sprint tasks that have been started
 - Separate Waffle Cards for backend work and theming work are likely. This is not a problem.
