##Final user demos - June 8 

30 min with Case worker (who requested anonymity) and 30 min with Amy Macalguim (foster parent) | [Video Recording](/documentation/ux/user-demos/final-demo-amy-06-08-16.mp4)

##Lead feedback: 
Case worker: 
- Would need spanish language site for many parents 
- Most useful function of map would be to help bio parents and foster parents arrange drop off locations (eg park, restaurant. not foster home). 
- Would be helpful when searching residential facilities to be able to see type of facility (level 10 group home, eg) 

Amy: 
- Love the idea that map may be used to help facilitate dropoff / pickup. This is a huge pain point. 
- Often bio parents have no dependable car. So showing bus routes would be helpful too

##Demo
RR: This is our final demo - 
- May not be able to implement changes, but this is important feedback regardless. Completing the circle of our interactions

###Case worker Demo

OB: Demonstration of profile
CW: this information is not public? 
OB: Access is managed through separate child profile 
CW: We are going to need Spanish translation as well 

OB: Demo of map 
RR: More often a biological parent would need to arrange drop to foster parent? 
- or residential facility? 
CW: no reason to know facility that I know 
- drop location yes
- visits are often not where child is living, tho, this is confidential 
RR: present options for parks, restaurants, etc, places for safe drop off? 

CW: See type of facility? Level 10 group home, eg? 
OB: depends on dataset that is available from the state 

OB: Demo of inbox 
- note this is a single case-worker account 
CW: Looks great

###Amy Demo 

OB: Demo of mobile video
- Demo of Profile 
AM: All looks good  

OB: Demo of Map
AM: Facilities are what? 
RR: Multibed homes 
- But we've confirmed that this would be more helpful if it could be used to arrange pickup / dropoff 

OB: Demo of table view too
- Responsive
AM: Fantastic 

AM: LOVE the idea that this could be used to help facilitate drop off. It's a big difficult process now 
RR: Often no car? 
AM: Yes, very often. And if they do have a car, it's rarely dependable. 
- Bus route info would be helpful 

OB: Demo of inbox 
- Each child has inbox - and messages would go to caseworker for that 
- This presumes single child / single caseworker 

AM: Urgent differential? (level of urgency) 
OB: Have a ticket for that, and may be able to implement 

SC: Communication between foster and bio, or does all have to be mediated by case worker? 
AM: Communication can be approved b/w bio, and may be monitored, but after that point comms can be handled bw bio and foster 

OB: Ultimately inbox would have checkbox, option, to notate who communication would go to 

AM: 98% of bios don't have access to internet 
- many don't even have access to phones, barring "obama phone" 
- so is this function even reasonable? 
RR: It may not be. Responding to RFI here, and realize that this may not reflect actual need 

RR: Would you be interested to write an article together based on our experience?  
AM: Yes!
